# prooph docs 

Source for docs.getprooph.org

Welcome at prooph! We are developing and supporting CQRS and EventSourcing infrastructure for PHP 7.1+ environments.
prooph is NOT a framework. Instead we provide components which address individual topics.

## Documentation

Compiled documentation is [in the docs tree](docs/).

## Source Docs

Source of the docs is managed in the [prooph/proophessor](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor) repository.

## Deployment (maintainers only)

Generate the docs using the commands listed in the README of prooph/proophessor.
The docs are published under `http://docs.getprooph.org/`. The sub domain points to the `docs` folder of this repo.
Copy the generated html from prooph/proophessor `docs/html` into the `docs` folder of this repo. Commit your changes and push the update (write access required)

## Support

- If you have questions regarding the docs you can ask them in [prooph gitter](https://gitter.im/prooph/improoph) chat.
