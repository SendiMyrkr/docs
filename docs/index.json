CQRS was first described by Greg Young. Our goal is to port his idea to the PHP world and make it easy to use for PHP developers.The basic concept is very simple. Let's look at a common service class:&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class UserService { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function createUser(int $id, string $name, string $email): User { $user = new User($id); $user-&gt;setName($name); $user-&gt;setEmail($email); $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;save($user); return $user; } public function getUser(int $id): User { $user = $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;get($id); if(!$user) { throw UserNotFoundException::withId($id); } return $user; } } The UserService is responsible for all actions related to a user. In a CQRS system this looks slightly different:CreateUserHandler.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class CreateUserHandler { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function createUser(int $id, string $name, string $email): void { $user = new User($id); $user-&gt;setName($name); $user-&gt;setEmail($email); $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;save($user); } } UserFinder.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class UserFinder { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function getUser(int $id): User { $user = $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;get($id); if(!$user) { throw UserNotFoundException::withId($id); } return $user; } } Instead of one service, we have two separate services one for handling the write action and one for handling the query. Note that CreateUserHandler::createUser(): void no longer returns the new user object. The method signature follows a basic rule of CQRS: Write operations don't have a return valueTo summarize CQRS in one sentence:A CQRS system is divided into two parts, a write model to handle all state changes and a read model to query that state.While this looks like overkill in the first place it enables you to design write and read side independent of each other. Let's look at a read-optimized UserFinder&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class UserFinder { private $connection; public function __construct(Connection $connection) { $this-&gt;connection = $connection; } public function getUser(int $id): array { $userData = $this-&gt;connection-&gt;findOneBy(['id' =&gt; $id]); if(!$userData) { throw UserNotFoundException::withId($id); } return $userData; } } We no longer use the UserRepository but instead directly access the database. So we avoid the object relational mapping and return pure user data from our finder. We can do this because we know that our read model won't do anything with the data other than forwarding it to a client that for example requires the data in JSON or XML format. If it is quaranteed that no state changes happen within the read model, we don't need to deal with objects as we don't need to enforce any rules. Select the data and return it to the client as fast as possible that is the target of the read model.The write model however has to protect invariants. At the moment our user object does a bad job on this.$user = new User($id); $user-&gt;setName($name); $user-&gt;setEmail($email); These three lines tell us that a User can exist in our system without a name and an email, only the id is required. For most of the systems this is not true. What about this?$user = User::create($id, $name, $email); Yeah, looks better now. Let's put it in the handler.&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class CreateUserHandler { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function createUser(int $id, string $name, string $email): void { $user = User::create($id, $name, $email); $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;save($user); } } Ok, but not perfect because we are missing intent. The code does not express why a user is created.The following code looks better, right?&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class RegisterUserHandler { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function registerUser(int $id, string $name, string $email): void { $user = User::register($id, $name, $email); $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;save($user); } } Finally, we add some prooph flavour and change the method of the handler to handle a prooph message&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class RegisterUserHandler { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function handle(RegisterUser $command): void { $user = User::register($command-&gt;userId(), $command-&gt;userName(), $command-&gt;email()); $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;save($user); } } With a few changes we turned our original UserService into two distinct classes supporting the basic idea of CQRS. In the last step we enabled the write side to handle a prooph command that expresses its intent of how the system state should change (a new user should be registered) using the message name RegisterUser and payload of the command. The RegisterUserHandler is a so called glue component. Its task is to take the command and translate the intent into an action performed by the write model (in our case the user). Finally, the command handler makes use of the infrastructure (represented by the UserRepository) to persist the state change caused by the command."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/introduction.html#1-1-5","title":"Event Sourcing","content":"Event Sourcing is covered in detail in the next chapter. What follows is a very basic introduction so that you can get an idea of what you'll learn when continue reading.In an event sourced system all state changes are described by events. The fact that a new user was registered in our system would be one of those events. Another one would be that the user has logged in or changed the email address.Let's analyze the last example. We start by looking at our database table after the user was registered. id name email 1 John Doe doe@test.com Applying CQRS again we end up with a new command ChangeEmail, an appropriate command handler and a matching action in the write model owned by the responsible object User::changeEmail&lt;?php declare(strict_types = 1); namespace Prooph\\Tutorial; class ChangeEmailHandler { private $userRepository; public function __construct(UserRepository $repository) { $this-&gt;userRepository = $repository; } public function handle(ChangeEmail $command): void { $user = $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;get($command-&gt;userId()); $user-&gt;changeEmail($command-&gt;newEmail()); $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;save($user); } } Performing a command like this:$changeEmail = new ChangeEmail([ 'userId' =&gt; 1, 'newEmail' =&gt; 'john.doe@test.com' ]); $handler-&gt;handle($changeEmail); will result in an updated database row id name email 1 John Doe john.doe@test.com What is wrong here? We've changed state but we don't know why and when it happened. Wouldn't it be nice if we could look at the database and see what caused the state change?What would you say if your database would give you this information instead?[{ event: UserWasRegistered, createdAt: 2017-01-13 payload: {id: 1, name: \"John Doe\", email: \"doe@test.com\"} }, { event: EmailWasChanged, createdAt: 2017-01-14 payload: {id: 1, newEmail: \"john.doe@test.com\"} }] Welcome to the world of Event Sourcing. This is only the beginning. When you are done with the walk-through tutorial you don't want to look back. Event Sourcing makes it so much simpler to create software that reflects intent and you have all information available to find bugs faster and add new features without pain.

The reason for it is not that Event Sourcing is a complex pattern but instead it conflicts with our current understanding of object oriented programming centered around data. More or less this understanding is driven by the way how we work with databases, mostly relational databases but it is not limited to them.Our primary goal is to put consistent data in a database and keep it consistent there. One of the common ways is to normalize data. Here the problem starts.Mapping the real world to a normalized view is a complex task and we tend to do it before we do anything else. Business describes a new feature and we immediately think of a possible data structure that fits into our favorite database design. We can share this thinking with our teammates because every programmer did the same in their head already so we can simply match results and are good to go. Are we?Well, not really. Often the first idea of a data structure does not work as expected so we have to reshape it and try again. Oh and not to forget this shitty real world. No one wants to view normalized data. So we have to write queries and make heavy use of data joins. Then we recognize that fetching the data with joins is inefficient and we use caches and other techniques to work around the limitation instead of solving the problem in the first place!But that's not all. The worst thing with this approach is that we design our application logic around data and not around behaviour.We skip the behaviour part of a feature description, turn the feature into our own view of normalized state and then reverse engineer behaviour.It's not hard to imagine that this approach leads to an application design driven by the database. So in fact it is a technical design which is far away from the original idea of the business. If you think this is the best way to tackle complexity of software then you can likely stop reading here because you won't have any fun with Event Sourcing.But if you cannot get rid of the feeling that there is something inherently wrong with database driven designs then you should read on, follow the tutorial and slowly but surely become a software developer focused on real business behaviour.Event Sourcing has many advantages in modern systems. It helps with coordinating work across different services. It can be used to solve performance and concurrency problems and many more.But the most important advantage of Event Sourcing is the focus on behaviour."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/event_sourcing_basics.html#1-3","title":"Event Sourcing Basics","content":"Event Sourcing focuses on business processes. The reason is simple. Every write operation in a domain model causes a state change. When using Event Sourcing those state changes are described by domain events. For example if an order gets payed this is a state change (company gets $$$) and we can describe it with an event using past tense: OrderPayed. We simply do that for all state changes. What we get is a series of domain events\u00c2\u00b9.Events happen one after another. They tell us a story about a business process handled by the application."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/event_sourcing_basics.html#1-3-1","title":"Thinking in Events","content":"The previous page \"Why Event Sourcing\" made a point about database driven designs and how Event Sourcing differs from that. In Event Sourcing we start with thinking in events.Every coding tutorial needs a playground. Ours is an eCommerce domain and our first job is to implement a shopping basket. Business tells us that customers can browse an online shop frontend and add available products to their basket. The customers don't need to be signed in so their basket is assigned to a shopping session until checkout. So far, so good. But the business wants us to implement realtime stock updates. While browsing the online shop customers should see constantly updated information about how many other customers have the same products in their basket: \"5 other customers want to buy the same product at the minute\". If one customer performs a checkout stock of the product should be reduced immediately along with a notification: \"Product {name} was bought by customer from {localization} {time span} ago\".Here is a simplified result of the event storming\u00c2\u00b2 session:As you can see we have a variety of different events. We not only have events that are caused by the customer while interacting with their shopping basket but also events caused by changes in foreign shopping sessions. We even have two \"error events\" defined: QuantityStockConflictDetected, ShoppingSessionTimedOut."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/event_sourcing_basics.html#1-3-2","title":"Defining Events","content":"In the tutorial introduction we already took a look at prooph messages and created our first command. Events are created in a similar fashion. In fact they are just another type of message. Hence, each prooph event is an implementation of Prooph\\Common\\Messaging\\Message.You still have the prooph_tutorial project at hand with prooph\/common installed via composer? If not, please go back to the introduction and follow the steps there before continuing with the Event Sourcing tutorial.We need a project structure for our shopping basket implementation.|_ Basket | |_ scripts | |_ src | | |_ Infrastructure | | | |_ Prooph | | |_ Model | | | |_ Basket | | | |_ Command | | | |_ Event | | | |_ ERP | | | |_ Exception | | |_ Projection | | |_ Query | |_ tests | |_Model |_ scripts Run the following command in the prooph_tutorial directory.$ mkdir -p .\/Basket\/src\/Infrastruture\/Prooph \\ .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Command\/ \\ .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Event\/ \\ .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket\/ \\ .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/ERP\/ \\ .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Exception\/ \\ .\/Basket\/src\/Projection\/Query \\ .\/Basket\/tests\/Model \\ .\/scripts Replace composer.json with this version and run composer update:{ \"autoload\": { \"psr-4\": {\"App\\\\Basket\\\\\": \"Basket\/src\/\"} }, \"autoload-dev\": { \"psr-4\": {\"App\\\\BasketTest\\\\\": \"Basket\/tests\/\"} }, \"require\": { \"prooph\/common\": \"^4.1\", \"prooph\/event-sourcing\": \"^5.2\" }, \"require-dev\": { \"phpunit\/phpunit\": \"^6.0\" } } We just configured composer's autoloader to use the namespace App\\Basket for our Basket context and the appropriate test namespace \u00c3\u0080pp\\BasketTest. We've also added the package prooph\/event-sourcing to the list of dependencies and told composer to install phpunit\/phpunit when we're in dev mode.You can guess that prooph\/event-sourcing provides the basic implementation needed to develop an event sourced domain model.Now it's time to define our first domain event. We place all events in .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Event\/File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Event\/ShoppingSessionStarted.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Event; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\BasketId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\ShoppingSession; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; final class ShoppingSessionStarted extends AggregateChanged { public function basketId(): BasketId { \/\/Note: Internally, we work with scalar types, but the getter returns the value object return BasketId::fromString($this-&gt;aggregateId()); } public function shoppingSession(): ShoppingSession { \/\/Same here, return domain specific value object return ShoppingSession::fromString($this-&gt;payload['shopping_session']); } } What we do here is extending the base event class AggregateChanged from the prooph\/event-sourcing package. More about aggregates in a minute. First let's have a look at what the base event class has to offer:&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace Prooph\\EventSourcing; use Assert\\Assertion; use Prooph\\Common\\Messaging\\DomainEvent; class AggregateChanged extends DomainEvent { \/** * @var array *\/ protected $payload = []; public static function occur(string $aggregateId, array $payload = []): self { return new static($aggregateId, $payload); } \/\/... } AggregateChanged extends Prooph\\Common\\Messaging\\DomainEvent. That's the link back to prooph\/common and turns all events into prooph messages. Keep that in mind as this is an important information needed later when we want to send events around.We also see a static factory method called occur that takes an $aggregateId and $payload as arguments. The $aggregateId is a reference to the corresponding aggregate. Every domain event belongs to exactly one aggregate."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/event_sourcing_basics.html#1-3-3","title":"Event Sourced Aggregates","content":"Event Sourced Aggregates are Domain-Driven Aggregates - units of consistency. They protect invariants. This basically means that an aggregate makes sure that it can transition to a new state. Different business rules can permit or prevent those state transitions. The aggregate has to enforce the business rules.In our case we need to consider following business rules: A shopping session is started with an empty basket. Each shopping session gets its own basket assigned. A product can only be added to a basket if at least one product is available in stock. Product quantity in a basket must not be higher than available stock. If stock is reduced by a checkout, product quantity in currently active baskets need to be checked and conflicts resolved. If product quantity in a basket is reduced to zero or less the product is removed from the basket. A checkout can only be made if no unresolved quantity-stock-conflicts exist for the basket. Looking at the rules we can identify a repeating pattern. Every rule includes a state check against a basket and\/or describes a state transition of a basket. With our current understanding of the domain we're good to go with a Basket aggregate that enforces the business rules described above.Even if we name our aggregate only Basket you can think of it like it would be named BasketProcess. We don't do it that way because it does not reflect the Ubiquitous Language\u00c2\u00b3 which we draw off from the language used by the business. However, when implementing Event Sourcing you can always keep that Process suffix in mind.Recap: Every state transition is described by an event. Events happen one after another. They tell us a story about a business process. Indeed, an aggregate is a process consisting of multiple steps happening in a sequence. Whereby, each next step is validated by the aggregate upfront using current state:A checkout can only be made if no unresolved quantity-stock-conflicts exist for the basket.Effective Aggregate Design\u00c2\u00b9\u00c2\u00b9 is possibly the hardest part of a well crafted domain model. And it evolves over time so be prepared to constantly refactor previous design decisions. Thinking of aggregates as processes and model them in an event sourced fashion can help a lot, but it remains a task that needs practice. So don't worry if your first attempts end up being unpractical. You will get better. Thinking in events and processes is the key.Let's add the Basket aggregate now.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateRoot; final class Basket extends AggregateRoot { protected function aggregateId(): string { \/\/ TODO: Implement aggregateId() method. } \/** * Apply given event *\/ protected function apply(AggregateChanged $event): void { \/\/ TODO: Implement apply() method. } } Our Basket class extends Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateRoot. This is the base class for all event sourced aggregates. Later we'll also look at an alternative approach using traits instead of extending a prooph class but the version shown here is easier to understand and helps us with the first steps. AggregateRoot is an abstract class and asks us to implement two methods aggregateId() which should provide the string representation of the globally unique identifier of the aggregate and an apply() method.The apply() method is best explained with an example so let us dive into the implementation. Each aggregate has a lifecycle. To start such a lifecycle we need to create the aggregate. But prooph's AggregateRoot does not allow to use the class constructor as public method. Instead we're asked to use a so called named constructor aka static factory method.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Event\\ShoppingSessionStarted; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\BasketId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\ShoppingSession; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateRoot; final class Basket extends AggregateRoot { public static function startShoppingSession( ShoppingSession $shoppingSession, BasketId $basketId) { \/\/Start new aggregate lifecycle by creating an \"empty\" instance $self = new self(); \/\/Record the very first domain event of the new aggregate \/\/Note: we don't pass the value objects directly to the event but use their \/\/primitive counterparts. This makes it much easier to work with the events later \/\/and we don't need complex serializers when storing events. $self-&gt;recordThat(ShoppingSessionStarted::occur($basketId-&gt;toString(), [ 'shopping_session' =&gt; $shoppingSession-&gt;toString() ])); \/\/Return the new aggregate return $self; } protected function aggregateId(): string { \/\/ TODO: Implement aggregateId() method. } \/** * Apply given event *\/ protected function apply(AggregateChanged $event): void { \/\/ TODO: Implement apply() method. } } A meaningful named constructor using the Ubiquitous Language is a great way to let the code document itself. The Basket aggregate requires a ShoppingSession and a BasketId to start the shopping session. Both are value objects that we're going to add next.Note: BasketId becomes the identifier of the aggregate but it is created outside of the aggregate. That's a common pattern in a CQRS system. For example the frontend can create a BasketId using a JavaScript UUID library and send the BasketId to the backend. Remember from the introduction chapter: Handling a command has no response other than success or failure. In case of success the frontend can use the BasketId to fetch state of the Basket from a read model. Later in the tutorial we'll see that in action. For now just keep in mind that aggregate ids are created by the client or application layer if a CQRS architecture is used.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket\/ShoppingSession.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket; final class ShoppingSession { private $shoppingSession; public static function fromString(string $shoppingSession): self { return new self($shoppingSession); } private function __construct(string $shoppingSession) { if($shoppingSession === '') { throw new \\InvalidArgumentException(\"Shopping session must not be an empty string\"); } $this-&gt;shoppingSession = $shoppingSession; } public function toString(): string { return $this-&gt;shoppingSession; } public function equals($other): bool { if(!$other instanceof self) { return false; } return $this-&gt;shoppingSession === $other-&gt;shoppingSession; } public function __toString(): string { return $this-&gt;shoppingSession; } } File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket\/BasketId.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket; use Ramsey\\Uuid\\Uuid; final class BasketId { private $basketId; public static function fromString(string $basketId): self { return new self($basketId); } private function __construct(string $basketId) { if(!Uuid::isValid($basketId)) { throw new \\InvalidArgumentException(\"Given basket id is not a valid UUID. Got \" . $basketId); } $this-&gt;basketId = $basketId; } public function toString(): string { return $this-&gt;basketId; } public function equals($other): bool { if(!$other instanceof self) { return false; } return $this-&gt;basketId === $other-&gt;basketId; } public function __toString(): string { return $this-&gt;basketId; } } Recap: We used a named constructor to create the Basket aggregate. The named constructor defines the requirements needed to start a shopping session, namely the ShoppingSession and BasketId. Instead of setting those value objects as properties in the Basket aggregate we record the first domain event ShoppingSessionStarted of the aggregate.Now the apply() method comes into play. Our Basket aggregate will have many more methods later to deal with all things happening during a shopping session. And in those methods we will often need the current state of the aggregate to protect invariants. To get access to the state we need to apply() recorded domain events in the exact same order as they were recorded. Prooph's \u00c3\u0080ggregateRoot takes care of the latter but it does not know how a domain event should be applied. Hence, we need to take over that task.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Event\\ShoppingSessionStarted; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\BasketId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\ShoppingSession; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateRoot; final class Basket extends AggregateRoot { \/** * @var BasketId *\/ private $basketId; \/** * @var ShoppingSession *\/ private $shoppingSession; public static function startShoppingSession(ShoppingSession $shoppingSession, BasketId $basketId) { $self = new self(); $self-&gt;recordThat(ShoppingSessionStarted::occur($basketId-&gt;toString(), [ 'shopping_session' =&gt; $shoppingSession-&gt;toString() ])); return $self; } protected function aggregateId(): string { \/\/ TODO: Implement aggregateId() method. } \/** * Apply given event *\/ protected function apply(AggregateChanged $event): void { \/\/A simple switch by event name is the fastest way, \/\/but you're free to split things up here and have for example methods like \/\/private function whenShoppingSessionStarted() \/\/To delegate work to them and keep the apply method lean switch ($event-&gt;messageName()) { case ShoppingSessionStarted::class: \/** @var $event ShoppingSessionStarted *\/ $this-&gt;basketId = $event-&gt;basketId(); $this-&gt;shoppingSession = $event-&gt;shoppingSession(); break; } } } Now that we have access to the current state we can finally implement the aggregateId() method to fulfill the contract defined by prooph's AggregateRoot class.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model; \/\/... final class Basket extends AggregateRoot { \/** * @var BasketId *\/ private $basketId; \/** * @var ShoppingSession *\/ private $shoppingSession; public static function startShoppingSession(ShoppingSession $shoppingSession, BasketId $basketId) { \/\/... } protected function aggregateId(): string { \/\/Return string representation of the globally unique identifier of the aggregate return $this-&gt;basketId-&gt;toString(); } \/** * Apply given event *\/ protected function apply(AggregateChanged $event): void { \/\/... } } Ok, that are the basics of Event Sourcing. Many new things to learn, right? But don't worry. You'll get used to it while we look at some more aspects of Event Sourcing. In the next part we will look at testing event sourced aggregates which is super easy when you have a clean and decoupled domain model.Advise: Revisit the basics part whenever you feel lost.

Add a project TestCase class that includes some helper methods which we can use in our test cases.File: .\/Basket\/tests\/TestCase.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\BasketTest; use PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase as PHPUnitTestCase; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\Aggregate\\AggregateType; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateRoot; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\EventStoreIntegration\\AggregateTranslator; class TestCase extends PHPUnitTestCase { \/** * @var AggregateTranslator *\/ private $aggregateTranslator; protected function popRecordedEvents(AggregateRoot $aggregateRoot): array { return $this-&gt;getAggregateTranslator()-&gt;extractPendingStreamEvents($aggregateRoot); } \/** * @return object *\/ protected function reconstituteAggregateFromHistory(string $aggregateRootClass, array $events) { return $this-&gt;getAggregateTranslator()-&gt;reconstituteAggregateFromHistory( AggregateType::fromAggregateRootClass($aggregateRootClass), new \\ArrayIterator($events) ); } private function getAggregateTranslator(): AggregateTranslator { if (null === $this-&gt;aggregateTranslator) { $this-&gt;aggregateTranslator = new AggregateTranslator(); } return $this-&gt;aggregateTranslator; } } The same TestCase is used in the example application proophessor-do\u00c2\u00b9. Besides the popRecordedEvents method we've also added a reconstituteAggregateFromHistory method. With the latter we can prepare an aggregate for a test case by just using events. So we can \"move\" the aggregate to a certain point in the business process and start testing from there. This is really powerful and as a benefit also self documenting. We'll see that in a minute.In the \"Event Sourcing Basics\" chapter we've implemented the Basket::startShoppingSession() method. Let's test it now with a BasketTest.File: .\/Basket\/tests\/Model\/BasketTest.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\BasketTest\\Model; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Event\\ShoppingSessionStarted; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\BasketId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\ShoppingSession; use App\\BasketTest\\TestCase; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; use Ramsey\\Uuid\\Uuid; class BasketTest extends TestCase { \/** * @var ShoppingSession *\/ private $shoppingSession; \/** * @var BasketId *\/ private $basketId; protected function setUp() { $this-&gt;shoppingSession = ShoppingSession::fromString('123'); $this-&gt;basketId = BasketId::fromString(Uuid::uuid4()-&gt;toString()); } \/** * @test *\/ public function it_starts_a_shopping_session() { $basket = Basket::startShoppingSession($this-&gt;shoppingSession, $this-&gt;basketId); \/** @var AggregateChanged[] $events *\/ $events = $this-&gt;popRecordedEvents($basket); $this-&gt;assertCount(1, $events); \/** @var ShoppingSessionStarted $event *\/ $event = $events[0]; $this-&gt;assertSame(ShoppingSessionStarted::class, $event-&gt;messageName()); $this-&gt;assertTrue($this-&gt;basketId-&gt;equals($event-&gt;basketId())); $this-&gt;assertTrue($this-&gt;shoppingSession-&gt;equals($event-&gt;shoppingSession())); } } The two value objects needed to start a shopping session are created in the setUp() method of the test case. This way we get fresh objects for each test without the need to create them manually in each test method.To run the test we need to tell PHPUnit where to find our test cases and how to use composer autoloader to locate the domain model. Just put a phpunit.xml.dist file in the project root with following content:File: .\/phpunit.xml.dist&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt; &lt;phpunit bootstrap=\"vendor\/autoload.php\"&gt; &lt;testsuites&gt; &lt;testsuite name=\"BasketModel\"&gt; &lt;directory&gt;.\/Basket\/tests&lt;\/directory&gt; &lt;\/testsuite&gt; &lt;\/testsuites&gt; &lt;\/phpunit&gt; Now we can run the tests with php vendor\/bin\/phpunit$ php vendor\/bin\/phpunit PHPUnit 6.3.1 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors. . 1 \/ 1 (100%) Time: 20 ms, Memory: 4.00MB OK (1 test, 4 assertions) Nice, a green test.

So do yourself and your colleagues a favor and test the domain model!"},{"id":"\/tutorial\/testing_aggregates.html#1-4-2","title":"Reconstitute From History","content":"For the first test we did not need the reconstituteAggregateFromHistory() test helper but if we add more behaviour to the Basket aggregate the test helper becomes quite handy.

First we need a new value object to reference a Product. Products are not part of our domain but are manged by an external ERP system.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/ERP\/ProductId.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP; final class ProductId { private $id; public static function fromString(string $id): self { return new self($id); } private function __construct(string $id) { if($id === '') { throw new \\InvalidArgumentException(\"Product id must not be an empty string\"); } $this-&gt;id = $id; } public function toString(): string { return $this-&gt;id; } public function equals($other): bool { if(!$other instanceof self) { return false; } return $this-&gt;id === $other-&gt;id; } public function __toString(): string { return $this-&gt;id; } } We need a new domain event, too.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Event\/ProductAddedToBasket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Event; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\BasketId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP\\ProductId; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; final class ProductAddedToBasket extends AggregateChanged { public function basketId(): BasketId { return BasketId::fromString($this-&gt;aggregateId()); } public function productId(): ProductId { return ProductId::fromString($this-&gt;payload()['product_id']); } } And finally we add a new method to the Basket aggregate that we're going to test in a few seconds.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket.php&lt;?php \/\/... use App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP\\ProductId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Exception\\ProductAddedTwice; final class Basket extends AggregateRoot { \/\/... \/** * @var ProductId[] *\/ private $products = []; public static function startShoppingSession(ShoppingSession $shoppingSession, BasketId $basketId) { \/\/... } public function addProduct(ProductId $productId): void { if(array_key_exists($productId-&gt;toString(), $this-&gt;products)) { throw ProductAddedTwice::toBasket($this-&gt;basketId, $productId); } \/\/@TODO: Check stock $this-&gt;recordThat(ProductAddedToBasket::occur($this-&gt;basketId-&gt;toString(), [ 'product_id' =&gt; $productId-&gt;toString()] )); } \/\/... \/** * Apply given event *\/ protected function apply(AggregateChanged $event): void { switch ($event-&gt;messageName()) { case ShoppingSessionStarted::class: \/\/... case ProductAddedToBasket::class: \/** @var $event ProductAddedToBasket *\/ \/\/Use ProductId as index to avoid adding a product twice $this-&gt;products[$event-&gt;productId()-&gt;toString()] = $event-&gt;productId(); break; } } } We have a new $products property which is a list of ProductIds whereby the string representation of the ProductId is also used as index. This way we can easily check if a product is added twice.The new addProduct() method takes a ProductId as argument and records a new domain event ProductAddedToBasket which then gets applied using a new case in the apply method.In case of a product being added twice the method throws a ProductAddedTwice exception.

First, we learned how to reconstitute an aggregate from history. We just added a few basket specific test helpers to get better type hinting support and keep creation of events in a central place for easier refactoring.Second, we learned how to test exceptions. Using exceptions to communicate errors is not always the best choice. Another possibility is to use domain events for failure scenarios, too. Later in the tutorial we will see this in action and discuss the pros and cons of such an approach.Anyway, testing failure cases where the aggregate records a failed event is not different from testing normal event recording. Reconstitute the aggregate to move it to a certain point in the business process, provoke the recording of a failure event and test if the event was correctly recorded. It's easy as that."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/testing_aggregates.html#1-4-3","title":"Links","content":" proophessor-do example app\u00c2\u00b9 "},{"id":"\/tutorial\/aggregate_dependencies.html#1-5","title":"Aggregate Dependencies","content":"In the previous chapters we've learned that an aggregate protects invariants and records an event for each state transition. It then applies recorded events to its internal state and uses the state to validate if the next state transition can take place.But not in all cases an aggregate can rely on its internal state only. Sometimes the aggregate needs to get information from somewhere else to make a decision. In this case the aggregate has a dependency to an external service and in this chapter we will learn how to give access to such a service and of course how to test it."},{"id":"\/tutorial\/aggregate_dependencies.html#1-5-1","title":"Method Injection","content":"You may have noticed that we've left a @TODO Check stock in the Basket::addProduct() method. Products are handled in an external ERP system and we can request current stock of a product from that system. When implementing Domain-Driven Design it is a common approach to integrate an external system by defining an interface for it in the domain model but move the implementation to the infrastucture layer. A good example of such an integration is shown in the PHP DDD Cargo Sample\u00c2\u00b9 where the Cargo domain makes use of an external GraphTraversalService. This is called Hexagonal Architecture or Ports &amp; Adapters\u00c2\u00b2.We want to use the same approach for the ERP system but limit the implementation to the interface only as we don't have access to the ERP system right now. We only know the interface specification. But that's enough because we can easily mock the ERP and use the interface to decouple our domain model from it.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/ERP\/ERP.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Exception\\UnknownProduct; interface ERP { \/** * Get stock information of given product * * If stock information cannot be fetched from the ERP system * this method returns null. * * If product is not known by the ERP system this method must throw an UnknownProduct exception * * @param ProductId $productId * @return ProductStock|null * @throws UnknownProduct *\/ public function getProductStock(ProductId $productId): ?ProductStock; } As you can see the ERP interface defines a method getProductStock which takes a ProductId as argument and returns a ProductStock value object or null in case the request failed. You may have noticed that we use value objects a lot. In fact everything except our Basket aggregate is modeled as a value object so far. It is a rule of thumb to model everything as value objects and only use an aggregate if the object really has a lifecycle in YOUR domain. Products of course have a lifecycle but in the ERP system and not in our basket domain. We only consume product data as read-only information. Hence, we are better of with using value objects to represent different aspects of a product like its stock information.Having said this, let's add the value object.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/ERP\/ProductStock.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP; final class ProductStock { \/** * @var ProductId *\/ private $productId; \/** * @var int *\/ private $quantity; \/** * @var int *\/ private $version; public static function fromArray(array $data): self { return new self( ProductId::fromString($data['product_id'] ?? ''), $data['quantity'] ?? 0, $data['version'] ?? 0 ); } private function __construct(ProductId $productId, int $quantity, int $version) { $this-&gt;productId = $productId; $this-&gt;quantity = $quantity; $this-&gt;version = $version; } \/** * @return ProductId *\/ public function productId(): ProductId { return $this-&gt;productId; } \/** * @return int *\/ public function quantity(): int { return $this-&gt;quantity; } \/** * @return int *\/ public function version(): int { return $this-&gt;version; } public function toArray(): array { return [ 'product_id' =&gt; $this-&gt;productId-&gt;toString(), 'quantity' =&gt; $this-&gt;quantity, 'version' =&gt; $this-&gt;version ]; } public function equals($other): bool { if(!$other instanceof self) { return false; } return $this-&gt;toArray() === $other-&gt;toArray(); } public function __toString(): string { return json_encode($this-&gt;toArray()); } } ProductStock gives us two important information: stock quantity a version Stock quantity is self-explaining and the version is related to that quantity. Whenever stock quantity of a product changes the version is increased by one. We can use the version during checkout to verify if the last known quantity of the product is still valid or if the quantity known by the basket is out-of-date.We also need a new UnknownProduct exception which is thrown by the ERP adapter in case the ERP system returns a not found response.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Exception\/UnknownProduct.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Exception; use App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP\\ProductId; final class UnknownProduct extends \\InvalidArgumentException { public static function withProductId(ProductId $productId): self { return new self(sprintf( 'Product with %s is unknown.', $productId-&gt;toString() )); } } Now the Basket aggregate should use the ERP system to request stock information before adding a product to the basket. The aggregate should reject the product if it is out of stock.Note: We keep the example simple. In a real world system this stock check would include many more variants for example permanent or temporarily out of stock products, checkout even if a product is out of stock, and so on.But how do we get the ERP adapter into the aggregate? The answer is Method Injection. The Basket::addProduct defines the \u00c3\u0088RP system as a dependency for that method. The caller of the method is responsible for providing an implementation. We see that in action when we look at command handlers. For now we align the method and update our test case.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Basket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model; \/\/... use App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP\\ERP; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Exception\\ProductOutOfStock; final class Basket extends AggregateRoot { \/\/... public function addProduct(ProductId $productId, ERP $ERP): void { if(array_key_exists($productId-&gt;toString(), $this-&gt;products)) { throw ProductAddedTwice::toBasket($this-&gt;basketId, $productId); } \/\/If the ERP system does not know the product an exception will be thrown here \/\/which will stop the operation. The aggregate can not deal with that situation \/\/as this is one of these \"this should never happen\" situations \/\/If we want an unbreakable domain model we would need to talk to the business \/\/and work out a failover plan triggered by a UnknownProductAddedToBasket event. $productStock = $ERP-&gt;getProductStock($productId); if(!$productStock) { $this-&gt;recordThat(ProductAddedToBasket::occur($this-&gt;basketId-&gt;toString(), [ 'product_id' =&gt; $productId-&gt;toString(), \/\/If we did not get a response, we add the product and check stock later again \/\/the shopping session should not be blocked by a temporarily unavailable ERP system 'stock_version' =&gt; null, 'stock_quantity'=&gt; null, 'quantity' =&gt; 1, ])); return; } if($productStock-&gt;quantity() === 0) { throw ProductOutOfStock::withProductId($productId); } $this-&gt;recordThat(ProductAddedToBasket::occur($this-&gt;basketId-&gt;toString(), [ 'product_id' =&gt; $productId-&gt;toString(), 'stock_version' =&gt; $productStock-&gt;version(), 'stock_quantity' =&gt; $productStock-&gt;quantity(), 'quantity' =&gt; 1, ])); } \/** * Apply given event *\/ protected function apply(AggregateChanged $event): void { switch ($event-&gt;messageName()) { case ShoppingSessionStarted::class: \/\/... case ProductAddedToBasket::class: \/** @var $event ProductAddedToBasket *\/ \/\/Use ProductId as index to avoid adding a product twice $this-&gt;products[$event-&gt;productId()-&gt;toString()] = [ 'stock_quantity' =&gt; $event-&gt;stockQuantity(), 'stock_version' =&gt; $event-&gt;stockVersion(), 'quantity' =&gt; $event-&gt;quantity() ]; break; } } } Basket::addProduct() has quite some logic now and uses an external ERP system to request stock information of the product. In case the ERP system is temporarily unavailable the Basket aggregate accepts the product without a stock quantity check. Later in the checkout process we need to take care of this situation and check stock again. If we have a quantity stock conflict during checkout the order is routed to a support team who needs to contact the customer and offer an alternative.If we got stock information from the ERP system we check quantity and throw a ProductOutOfStock exception if it is zero.File: .\/Basket\/src\/Model\/Exception\/ProductOutOfStock.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Exception; use App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP\\ProductId; final class ProductOutOfStock extends \\RuntimeException { public static function withProductId(ProductId $productId): self { return new self(sprintf( 'Product with %s is out of stock.', $productId-&gt;toString() )); } } If everything is ok the Basket aggregate accepts the product and records the ProductAddedToBasket event but now with additional information so we need to add new getter methods to the event.File: .\/Baset\/src\/Model\/Event\/ProductAddedToBasket.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\\Basket\\Model\\Event; use App\\Basket\\Model\\Basket\\BasketId; use App\\Basket\\Model\\ERP\\ProductId; use Prooph\\EventSourcing\\AggregateChanged; final class ProductAddedToBasket extends AggregateChanged { public function basketId(): BasketId { return BasketId::fromString($this-&gt;aggregateId()); } public function productId(): ProductId { return ProductId::fromString($this-&gt;payload()['product_id']); } public function stockQuantity(): ?int { return $this-&gt;payload()['stock_quantity']; } public function stockVersion(): ?int { return $this-&gt;payload()['stock_version']; } public function quantity(): int { return $this-&gt;payload()['quantity']; } } In the apply method of the Basket aggregate these additional information is added to the internal state so that we have access to it later.Testing the expanded version of Basket::addProduct() is still relatively simple but we end up with a lot more test methods to cover the different results of the method call. Check the additions below and see how we can use PHPUnit's prophecy integration to mock the ERP system and simulate different situations.File: .\/Basket\/tests\/Model\/BasketTest.php&lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);

If the message does not implement the interface the detect-message-name priority can be used to add a plugin to inject the name using ActionEvent::setParam('message-name', $messageName).

A finalize plugin can unset the exception by calling ActionEvent::setParam(\"exception\", null).

This reduces the number of cpu cycles without the projection doing any real work.OPTION_PERSIST_BLOCK_SIZE = 'persist_block_size';The persist block size tells the projector to persist its changes after a given number of operations. This increases the speed of the projection a lot. When you only persist every 1000 events compared to persist on every event, then 999 write operations are saved. The higher the number, the fewer write operations are made to your system, making the projections run faster. On the other side, in case of an error, you need to redo the last operations again.

The easiest way is to take your application offline, perform the upcasting script, deploy the new version of the application, and bring the system online again.A more complex option with no or very little downtime is to use a special MessageFactory. First, make the MessageFactory aware of the differences between v1 and v1.1 of your events. Deploy the modified factory together with version 1.1 of your application. The factory takes care of translating old events into new ones. Perform the \"upcasting\" script in the background, and, once it has replaced all old events, you can remove the translation logic from the factory again and exchange it with the simple factory you used before.Note: Each event store adapter allows you to set it up with a custom message factory.

EventSourcedTrait is responsible for restoring state from event stream, it should be used together with EventProducerTrait as normally you will not be applying events not produced by that aggregate root.

It is an abstract class implementing the container-interop RequiresContainerId interface. The containerId method itself is not implemented in the abstract class. You have to extend it and provide the container id because each aggregate repository needs a slightly different configuration and therefore needs its own config key.Note: You can have a look at the ProophTest\\EventStore\\Mock\\RepositoryMockFactory. It sounds more complex than it is.Let's say we have a repository factory for a User aggregate root.

The event store does not implement the commit method in all cases now, only the ones implementing the Prooph\\EventStore\\TransactionalEventStore interface. Also not all event stores are needed to trigger action events. Only the ones that are wrapped by Prooph\\EventStore\\ActionEventEmitterEventStore or Prooph\\EventStore\\TransactionalActionEventEmitterEventStore.
